## Accepting submissions!

Submissions are open until December 1st, 2025!

We are accepting abstracts that showcase the many ways that our diverse community uses R. Share with the audience how you use R in your professional career across all disciplines or even for personal projects. **We accept a wide range of topics, including R packages and web-apps, analytics and modeling, emerging trends in R, and ways to foster community and collaboration**. Additionally, we would love to hear from the data practitioners who use R to raise awareness of LGBTQ+ issues!

The types of abstracts we are accepting includes:

- **Regular talks** (15-20 minutes): A traditional conference talk showcasing an R application, project, or insight. Speakers are encouraged to keep their presentations 15–17 minutes to allow for a Q&A.
- **Lightning talks** (5 minutes, prerecorded): A brief, prerecorded talk showcasing an R application, project, or insight.

Note, we have the option of converting regular talks into lightning talks if the regular talk is rejected.

## Deadlines
