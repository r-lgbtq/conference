Connecting LGBTQ+ R users is a key aim of the conference. 
We're hosting two social events in the schedule.
We're also running a special conference edition of [buddies](https://rainbowr.org/buddies), 
the flagship rainbowR programme for randomly connecting community members.

See the [schedule](schedule.qmd) for the times in other timezones.

## Quiz and social

**Wednesday February 25th, 18:05-18:55 UTC**

Damie Pak and Libby Heeren are running a quiz and social on the first day of the conference, between the two workshop sessions.
This will be a chance first to test your R, data science and queer pop-culture knowledge in a fun and quick-fire way (with posit swag for the top scorers), 
before hanging out in facilitated breakout rooms to chat with other community members.

## Birds of a feather

**Thursday February 26th, 18:30-18:30 UTC**

Birds of a feather sessions offer on opportunity to connect with folks with similar interests.
We'll gather in one Zoom meeting, then be able to split out into separate breakout rooms with different themes.
Themes are not yet confirmed, but ideas include:

🗺️ Maps/spatial data 

💊 R in medicine/pharma 

🎉 R for fun 

📦 R package development 

📈 R in production 

⚾️ contributing to base R 

🧑‍🏫 R educators 

There should be the ability to create rooms on the fly on the day, depending on the interests of those present.

## Buddies

The buddies scheme is a flagship rainbowR programme which randomly pairs members of the community, providing an opportunity to foster connections and encouraging conversations between people who may not meet otherwise.

We're running a special conference edition! Until February 18th (a week before the conference), 
folks who register for the conference will have the opportunity, during the registration process, to request a conference buddy.
During check-out, you'll be asked a couple of questions about yourself and your interests. 
In the run-up to the conference, we'll randomly assign you a buddy and send an email to each pair, making the introduction, populated with the information you provided in your answers to help get the conversation started. 

We encourage you to connect with your buddy in advance of the conference.
And, during the conference itself, you'll then know (at least) one person attending, who you can be in touch with in the conference Slack and Zoom chats.

See <https://rainbowr.org/buddies> for more details on how the scheme works (and how it's implemented in R!)

## Discord

We'll have a Discord server for the conference, for further chat and socialising, and getting in touch with the organisers.
Everyone registered for the conference will be invited to join, probably a couple of days before the conference starts.
