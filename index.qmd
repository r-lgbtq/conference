## Welcome
The inaugural [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.org) virtual conference will bring together LGBTQ+ users of R to promote their work and foster connections among community members. 
We will present an extraordinary lineup of LGBTQ+ speakers across keynotes, regular talks and lightning talks, 
who will showcase the immense diversity of R users as well as the vast possibilities of what you can do in R. 
In addition to the talks, we will also be hosting multiple virtual [workshops](workshops.qmd) led by experts, such as on using open-source data to tackle LGBQT+ issues.
