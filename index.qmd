## Welcome
The inaugural [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.org) virtual conference will bring together LGBTQIA+ users of R, and their allies, to promote their work and foster connections amongst the community. 
We have an excellent lineup of LGBTQIA+ [speakers](speakers.qmd) across fifteen [talks](talks.qmd): two keynotes, six regular talks and seven lightning talks. 
The conference showcases the diversity of R users as well as the vast possibilities of what you can do in R. 
In addition to the talks, we are running four virtual [workshops](workshops.qmd) led by experts, as well as virtual [socials](socials.qmd) where conference participants can meet other R users to connect, share experiences, and unwind.

## Who is the conference for?
The conference is for *anyone* interested in R and/or analysing data to understand LGBTQ+ issues.
The majority of speakers and workshop leaders are LGBTQ+, but you do *not* have to be LGBTQ+ to attend.

## About rainbowR
rainbowR is a community whose mission is to connect, support and promote LGBTQ+ R users, 
and to spread awareness of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism.
